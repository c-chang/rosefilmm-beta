* OKAY. DIRECTIONS! :) 
*
* Basically ONLY edit text that is in between quotation marks. To prevent any unwanted errors, make sure that all quotations have an opening and closing pair! 
* Also, there is usually a semi-colon at the end of lines, but not always. 
* For Example: 
     const brand_name = "rosefilmm";     <--- You only want to change the text "rosefilmm" to something else. Keep the beginning and ending quotes.
     const brand_name = "helloworld";    <--- This is how it should look if you wanted the brand_name value to be "helloworld" instead of "rosefilmm".
*
* Adding images:
     For the gallery thumbnail hover title and subtitle, you need to uncomment new sections in the "projects" dictionary below, and add your title/subtitle in the quotes.
*
